A Linear Diophantine Equation (in two variables) is an equation of the general form:
$$ax + by = c$$
where $a$, $b$, $c$ are given integers, and $x$, $y$ are unknown integers. Code gives a single solution for $x$ and $y$ for any other solution we can use:
$$x = x_0 + k \cdot \frac{b}{g}, \qquad y = y_0 - k \cdot \frac{a}{g}$$
