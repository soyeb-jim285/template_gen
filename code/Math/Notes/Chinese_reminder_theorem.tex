Let $m = m_1 \cdot m_2 \cdots m_k$, where $m_i$ are pairwise coprime. In addition to $m_i$, we are also given a system of congruences
$$\left\{\begin{array}{rcl}
    a & \equiv & a_1 \pmod{m_1} \\
    a & \equiv & a_2 \pmod{m_2} \\
      & \vdots & \\
    a & \equiv & a_k \pmod{m_k}
\end{array}\right.$$
where $a_i$ are some given constants. The original form of CRT then states that the given system of congruences always has *one and exactly one* solution modulo $m$.
